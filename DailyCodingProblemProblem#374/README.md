Given a sorted array `arr` of distinct integers, return the lowest index `i` for which `arr[i] == i`. Return null if there is no such index.

For example, given the array `[-5, -3, 2, 3]`, return `2` since `arr[2] == 2`. Even though `arr[3] == 3`, we return `2` since it's the lowest index.


# Solution:
So my approach to this was to brute force it which make the soltuion a linear one with O(N), which I left in the solution as a seperate method. what we need to achieve here is O(LogN)

## Time Complexity:

method `OLogNSoltuion` O(LogN)
method `OofNSolution` O(N)
